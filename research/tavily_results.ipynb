Based off research and personal experience here are some of the best North Beach restaurants in San Francisco:\\n\\nTonys Pizza Napoletana - this pizza place was only about a 10 minute walk from our hotel in Fisherman’s Wharf and it’s the best pizza in San Francisco. We had a great dinner here on our last night in the city.\\n\\nBarbara Pinseria & Cocktail Bar\\n\\nCapo’s\\n\\nTrattoria Contadina [...] Il Casaro Pizzeria\\n\\nPiccolo Forno\\n\\nLush Gelato for a sweet treat\\n\\nFisherman’s Wharf Pier 39\\n\\nFisherman’s Wharf\\n\\nIn my opinion Fisherman’s Wharf is the best place to stay while visiting San Francisco. There are some fantastic restaurants in the area plus its super easy to walk to Chinatown, North Beach district, and other areas from here. We stayed at Hotel Zephyr during our action packed 7 day trip and it was perfect. San Francisco was surprisingly walkable despite the hills.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Verjus’ reopening after four years makes me excited about SF’s future. It is a party every night of the week with low lighting, loud voices, and happy vibes. The food is hearty, but not fussy. Order the mussels escabeche, tuna crudo, Boursin omelet and duck confit, but make sure you leave space for the pain perdu (like a french toast dessert but better).\\n\\n3. Tiya [...] Breadbelly is off the list because they broke my heart by not bringing back my favorite tomato sandwich. I’m also dropping Californios, Ssal, and Noodle in a Haystack since I didn’t have an opportunity to revisit them this year, so I can’t confirm if they have maintained their magic (although I assume they have!). In their place I’ve added Four Kings, Verjus, Tiya, and Spruce’s Bar. [...] Special mentions\\n\\nAtelier Crenn — My best bite of the year was one of the first dishes in this tasting menu extravaganza- a small tart layered with caviar, avocado, lime, and sesame that came together perfectly.\\n\\nAcquerello\\u200a— This restaurant feels like going back in time with its hushed atmosphere and waiters in suits. The food is delicious (although not wildly exciting). It’s perfect when you want a special occasion meal where you’re made to feel very very comfortable.'},\n",
